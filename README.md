Click-Through Rate Prediction with Machine Learning
In any advertising agency, it is very important to predict the most profitable users who are very likely to respond to targeted advertisements. In this article, I’ll walk you through how to train a model for the task of click-through rate prediction with Machine Learning using Python.
By predicting the click-through rate, an advertising company select the most potential visitors who are most likely to respond to the ads, analyzing their browsing history and showing the most relevant ads based on the interest of the user.

This task is important for every advertising agency because the commercial value of promotions on the Internet depends only on how the user responds to them. A user’s response to ads is very valuable to every ad company because it allows the company to select the ads that are most relevant to users.
